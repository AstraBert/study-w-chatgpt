<h3>Tutorial transcript</h3>

You first have to log-in into your ChatGPT account.

Once you are logged in, you should go click on your avatar, at the top right of the page, and then go to `'Customize ChatGPT'`.

Here you should write something about you, so that the agent knows who they're dealing with, and then give some **in-depth instructions** on the subject and on the type of responses you want to get. _It is highly suggested to also specify the language you want these responses to be in._

After you have completed this portion, you can simply upload your PDFs with the `Attachment` button, and then you can start chatting.

> _It is advisable to query ChatGPT in English and not in your language: if you set the language of ChatGPT answers in the customized instructions, you should nevertheless get them in that desired language._

A really good prompt to get the most out of ChatGPT may be: **"Answer the following question leveraging information on the subject from the PDF I uploaded and (if it is  not enough) from your own knowledge:"** And then you put your question.

If there is any portion of ChatGPT's answer which is unclear, you can use the `Quote` function by selecting the text and clicking on the quotation marks. You may then ask something like this: **"Related to the quoted portion attached to this message, could you please expand and clarify it by adding information on the subject from your knowledge and from the PDF I uploaded?"**
